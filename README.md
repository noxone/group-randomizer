# Group Randomizer

A tiny tool to randomize group members.

## Use case

When sitting in home office it is still great to have a daily stand up meeting. But unlike in the office, it is not so easy to agree on an order for the team members to speak. You don't want to have the same order every day. Looking at each other is also not that easy because it's only a digital version of your colleagues.

This tool is intended to remedy this, in order to create a suitable, random order for the stand-up meeting in a matter of seconds.
